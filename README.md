# History Lesson

The foundation for y_customs, Popcornrp-Customs, was created following the subsequent discovery of QB-Customs containing stolen/leaked code. Popcornrp-Customs is a total replacement for QB-Customs, meant to replace it and improve on its original functionality.

Popcornrp-customs was released as a thank-you to the FiveM open-source community and all the developers who have poured thousands of hours of their free time into creating helpful, free resources.

Thank you!
